  Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities and secrets.
  Vulnerability scan is performed by Grype (https://github.com/anchore/grype)
  while scanning for secrets is executed by Trivy (https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).
  It is possible to provide additional configurable options by following the Grype
  (https://github.com/anchore/grype?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) and Trivy
  (https://trivy.dev/latest/docs/configuration/) guides, respectively.
  However, some options cannot be overridden, such as source and format,
  since they are passed as command line arguments and thus have the highest precedence.

parameters:
  image:
    type: string
    description: >
      The Docker image to scan. Support following schemes
      (1) 'repo-name/image-name:tag' (2) '/path/to/image.tar'. Bases on provided scheme
      it will either use local Docker daemon or tarball archive from disk as a source.
      Performs environment variable substitution before using the value of this parameter.
  scanners:
    type: string
    default: vuln secret
    description: >
      Space delimited list of scans to run against the image. By default, runs all
      available scans. Following is available (1) 'vuln' - vulnerability scan
      (2) 'secret' - secrets scan of the image and its configuration.
  severity:
    type: enum
    enum:
      - low
      - medium
      - high
      - critical
    default: high
    description: >
      Choose a severity level to fail on with the error code. By default,
      when severity level of 'high' or greater is detected the command will
      fail with exit code 2.
  exclude:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >
      Space delimited list of GLOB expressions specifying files and paths to
      exclude from the vulnerability scan. The secrets scan is not affected by this.
  ignore_fix_status:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >
      Comma delimited list of matches to ignore based on the vulnerability fix status.
      Available options - 'fixed', 'not-fixed', 'wont-fix', 'unknown'.
  report_format:
    type: enum
    enum:
      - cyclonedx-json
      - json
    default: cyclonedx-json
    description: >
      Choose the format of the vulnerability report. By default, a JSON format
      conforming ot the CycloneDX specification.
  report_path:
    type: string
    default: /tmp/security-orb/output/image-findings.json
    description: Path to the file to write the vulnerability report to.
