  The "generate_sbom" command generates SBOM from the Docker image.
  By default, the Docker daemon is used as a source. This can be changed
  to use the Docker archive from the disk by providing the path to the tarball
  file as the "image".
  There is an option to customize output path of the report, exclude
  directories or files from the scan with glob expressions or use
  different output format.
