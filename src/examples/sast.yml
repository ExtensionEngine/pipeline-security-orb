  The "analyze_code_diff" job runs a static analysis tool to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
  A diff-aware scanning is performed meaning only file changes in the last commit are scanned,
  or files scoped to the pull request if a short-lived branch is in question.
  There is an option to change a base branch and enforce a different set of scan rules.
