  By default, the "assess_image" command scans images for high and critical
  severity vulnerabilities and secrets. It uses the Docker daemon as the
  image source, or alternatively an image tarball file from disk if provided.
  There is an option to choose scanners, set severity levels, ignore findings
  based on fix status, exclude directories or files using the glob expressions,
  select different report format, and customize report path.
