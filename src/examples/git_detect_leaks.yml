  The "detect_secrets_git" job checks for secrets leak inside a Git repository.
  When a current branch is not a base branch it scans all commits inside the current branch.
  If the current branch and base branch are the same it scans commits from base revision
  up to last commit in a build.
  The base revision should be provided for the most accurate results, while the base branch
  can be overridden if necessary.
